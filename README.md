# Movie-Recommendation-App

This is a Buildspace project. 

During a 2-week learn-a-thon, I wrote a smart contract using Solidity, 
deployed the smart contract to the blockchain, and created a web3 client app 
that interacts with the smart contract by allowing users to send me movie recommendations.

I received an NFT for being a part of the first 200 people to complete the learn-a-thon challenge.
