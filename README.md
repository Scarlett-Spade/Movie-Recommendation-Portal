# ABOUT

During a two-week sprint, I coded and deployed an Ethereum smart contract with an accompanying NFT collection and interactive web app using Solidity and React amongst 400+ developers. As a Buildspace learn-a-thon, there was a live "kick-off" showcasing an intro to the project scope. There were scheduled, hour-long coworking sessions where lo-fi beats played as we indivdually worked alongside the developer community.

# USE CASE

For my project, I advertised a faux film screening of Beetlejuice. Users can mint an NFT for a virtual screening password by connecting their Metamask wallet to the free Rinkeby testnet. They will own their NFT and can re-sell their NFT on the Opensea marketplace.
