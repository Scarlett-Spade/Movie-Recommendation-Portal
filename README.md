# NFT-App

This is a Buildspace project. 

During a 7-day learn-a-thon, I wrote an Ethereum smart contract using Solidity, 
programmatically generated my own NFT collection, and created a React dApp 
allowing users to mint the NFT collection.

I received an NFT for completing the learn-a-thon challenge within the 7-day sprint.
